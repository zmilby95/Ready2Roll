# About the project
Ready2Roll is a dice rolling console app that allows the user to roll as many dice as they want with as many sides as they desire. The program then records the roll totals and sorts them in a list based off of the score and the time the user rolled the dice.

# Features 
1. Master loop 
2. Created a list and retrieved the value
3. Calculate and display the data based on the date and time

# How to run
Clone the repo, run program.cs, follow the prompt. The loop to roll again will keep going until n is typed when asked if you want to roll again. Once the user has decided to not roll again the date, time, and roll totals will list.
